Hey Sonny, baby! I tricked some undergrads into helping me knock out that script you wanted. Here's what we have so far:

Act 1:
----------
Ok so there is like this pixie princess in like a forest or something? Disney's making a ton of money off that stuff, right? Anyway she like gets introduced here or something? Maybe by like showing she's good at something but also with some kind of relatable flaw?

Anyway the hook is something happens here that needs to be resolved by the end of the story.

Act 2:
----------
Here's where she has to do things she didn't think she could do. You know, get put out of her comfort zone a bit. Overcome challenges, discover new abilities, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Act 3:
----------
The climatic battle. Use the stuff learned from act 2 to fix the the stuff from act 1. (Can we attach Michael Bay to this? I see ninja robot pirates fighting dinosaur cyborg cowboys on a time travelling space station. Cornpone 18-35's in Peoria should eat that junk up.)

Act 4:
----------
The denoument. The stuff from act 1 is fixed, the heroine has grown, and the youth center is saved or whatever. Give the schmucks in the audience their sappy ending.
